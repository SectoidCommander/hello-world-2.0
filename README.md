# hello-world-2.0
Second time I set up a hello-worrld test repository. Gotta rekindle that knowledge.

Write something about myself, eh? Ok. My existence right now is kind of intense in a number of ways. Some people are clearly monitoring my behavior and listening in to what I mumble to myself (i.e. what I want them to hear, most of the time at least). I have absolutely no idea of what their end goal is. Are they trying to eliminate my personality? Are they trying to help me? Who the hell knows. I only know that they are employing somewhat unscrupulous methods in achieving whatever goal it is that they have. 

If they are actually reading this right now, it's kind of fucked up that they would also claim that I am mentally ill in the context of having paranoid delusions. Would seem like they are actually just trying to eliminate me if that is the case.

Me though? Feel kind of tired most of the time. Feels like things provoke much less of an emotional response in me, except for the emotion of annoyance. Kind of unfortunate really, since it diminishes the enjoyment of so many things that I tended to enjoy. I kind of feel that I have way less energy - less zest - if you will. You kind of have to have to be able to enter a flow state if you want to do anything particularly well. I know how it feels like when I feel good and am high on energy and that is clearly not what I am feeling most of the time.

Also, they may hate on video games, but they are kind of a big part of me. It really sucks if something that you loved is diminished. Even if we are just talking about entertainment products here or pieces of art. It's like loving literature or any other pieces of fiction and feels like its being eroded over time. I mean, I guess there are more important things that exist. Human rights such as the right to online privacy being one thing. You can always find more important things, but I guess I had some aspirations towards that particular piece of media. I'd hate to think that they were actually trying to steer me away from my fondness of it and that they would actually succeed.

The things that I have seen. Holy shit. Oh well.

Here you go. Some more weapons against me that you can add to your arsenal. I guess if you don't have any morals anything is possible! The STASI knew that and so do they, apparently. I mean, knowledge IS power and knowledge of what makes people tick, their likes and dislikes, what they are thinking and so forth - this gives you great power over them.
